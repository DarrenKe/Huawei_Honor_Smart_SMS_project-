This project is to build a Smart SMS SDK based on sentimental analysis on the original message text
to provide intelligent services related to that message. Moreover, the original message will be converted into  
a more beautiful and intuitive user interface without losing key information.

For example, when a user recieves a credit card payment message, the SDK will automatically recognize it 
as a "credit card payment" category and the raw text will be converted into a table with bank name, payment amount, due time
so that a user can quikly figure out what the message is about. Further, a service prediction engine will provide "one key to pay" service button for this message, which extreamly facilites the payment process. 
One more example, when a user recieves a flight ticket confirming message, the SDK will classify it as "Flight Booking" category 
and this message will be displayed as a ticket interface instead raw text. Also, some potential services like hotel,resturant and map service will be provided for this message as a service button.

This project has been embeded into almost all latest android devices with SMS like Huawei, Sumsung, Lenovo, Meizu, Sumsung Galaxy Gear, 360 and so on. The number of devices embeded with this project reached more than 500 million by July 2016.

Due to aggrement with the company, no code will be shared.
