# Huawei_Honor_Smart_SMS_project
This project is to build a Smart SMS SDK based on sentimental analysis of the original message text
to provide intelligent service related to the message. Moreover, the original message will be displayed 
as a more beautiful and intuitive user interface.

For example, when a user recieves a credit card payment message, the SDK will automatically recognize it 
as a "credit card payment message class" and will provide users with "one key to pay" service, which is pretty convinient. 
One more example, when you recieved a confermed-flight-booking message, the SDK will classify it as "Flight Booking" message 
and will provide you with destination hotel service, destination map service and resturant service for your destination.

This project has been embeded into almost all newest android mobile phones like Huawei, Sumsung, Lenovo, Meizu, Sumsung Galaxy Gear, 360 and so on. Currently the users embeded with this function is more than 500 million.

Due to aggrement with the company, no code will be shared.
