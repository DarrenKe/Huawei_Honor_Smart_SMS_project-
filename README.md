This project is to build a Smart SMS SDK based on sentimental analysis on the original message text to provide intelligent services related to that message. Moreover, the original message will be converted into a beautiful and intuitive user interface without losing key information.

For example, when a user recieves a credit card payment message, the SDK will automatically recognize it as a "credit card payment" category and the raw text will be converted into a table with bank name, payment amount, due time, so that a user can quikly figure out what the message is about. Further, a service prediction engine will provide "one key to pay" service button for this message, which extreamly facilitates the payment process. 
One more example, when a user recieves a flight ticket message, the SDK will classify it as "Flight Booking" category and this message will be displayed as a ticket interface instead of raw text. Also, some potential services like hotel,resturant and map service will be provided for this message as a service button.

This project has been embeded into almost all latest Android devices with SMS like Huawei, Sumsung, Lenovo, Meizu, Sumsung Galaxy Gear, 360 and so on. The number of devices embeded with this project had reached more than 500 million.

Due to aggrement with the company, no code will be shared.
