This project is to build a Smart SMS SDK based on sentimental analysis on the original message text
to provide intelligent services related to that message. Moreover, the original message will be displayed 
with a more beautiful and intuitive user interface.

For example, when a user recieves a credit card payment message, the SDK will automatically recognize it 
as a "credit card payment" category and will provide user with "one key to pay" service, which extreamly facilites the payment process. 
One more example, when a user recieves a flight ticket confirming message, the SDK will classify it as "Flight Booking" category 
and will provide the user with hotel information, map and resturant service of the trip's destination.

This project has been embeded into almost all newest android mobile phones like Huawei, Sumsung, Lenovo, Meizu, Sumsung Galaxy Gear, 360 and so on. Currently the users embeded with this function have reached more than 500 million.

Due to aggrement with the company, no code will be shared.
